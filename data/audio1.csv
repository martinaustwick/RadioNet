A1,Springtime It Brings On The Shearing,"A type of radio documentary, but one where the event is seen as through a pane of old and imperfect glass: time, distance and memory combine to blur the image. The reality is always - slightly - out of focus.
Shearers have been shearing sheep in almost the same way since Europeans first came to Australia. Shearing is a centre of white Australian memory.
'When we were children, we used to go to the shearing sheds, sometimes.' Something to do with history. Something to do with time.

This controversial, award winning documentary was recorded in the besieged city if Sarajevo in 1992, at the height of the civil war in the former Yugoslavia, and was first broadcast in 1993. It won the Prix Italia for best documentary in that year. Twenty years on, this extraordinary documentary remains a provocative portrait of men and women engaged in a cruel and deadly game: the killing of other men and women who not so long ago were their fellow citizens. Sniper was made by Stephen Schwartz, an American who worked for most of his career as a documentary maker with Radio Denmark, based in Copenhagen.

Initially, Cage composed the work based on his ideas involving electronic sound effects, assuming it could be realized in the CBS sound studios. A week before the radio broadcast, however, when Cage presented at the studios to make the recordings, he was told by the resident technician that what he wanted to do could not be done in the time allotted. Cage had to compose another work, just four days before the scheduled broadcast. The original manuscript is probably lost. The instruments called for include tin cans, muted gongs, woodblocks, alarm bells, tam tam, bass drum, Chinese tom tom, bongos, cowbells, maracas, claves, ratchet, pod rattle, foghorn, thunder sheet, sound-effect recordings, etc. The script recounts a surreal tale of a man called ‘The Voice' who wanders around a big city, meeting various characters and finding himself in mysterious circumstances.

A63,What's Rangoon to you is Grafton to me,"Back in the 1970s, the straight-laced ABC veered off the beaten path with a new experiment: Double J—a youth-oriented radio channel operating on a derelict AM transmitter in a bomb shelter. One of the channel's more live-wire DJs was a surfer-poet called Russell Guy. His crazed, ad-lib breakfast shows broke all the rules of broadcasting. In 1978, Guy decided to see if he could turn a short story about a summer hitch-hiking adventure from Brisbane to Sydney into a radio play. What's Rangoon to You is Grafton to Me ultimately went on to become a cult classic. He enlisted the help of ABC's beloved anchorman, James Dibble, to play his whacked-out road warrior protagonist and was initially produced in 4 track for the AM Double Jay, co-produced by Guy and Graham Wyatt, but in 1983, as Double Jay became Triple Jay stereo FM, Rangoon, as it’s affectionately known, was remixed by Geoff Overmyer and Chris Norris, giving it a new lease of audio life. Rangoon materialised from Guy’s two years on Double Jay breakfast’s show and was adapted to the stage for a short season at the Metro, Brisbane in 1992.",1978,ABC,B1,,,-33.8762946,151.2190482,Australia,http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/soundproof/features/from-the-vault/whats-rangoon-to-you-is-grafton-to-me/6759216,Russell Guy,P77,,,,,,

May 24 is the anniversary of the second big attack on Tokyo.

The eight voices are not used in a traditional classical way; they frequently do not sing at all, but speak, whisper and shout words by Claude Lévi-Strauss, whose Le cru et le cuit provides much of the text, excerpts from Samuel Beckett's novel The Unnamable, instructions from the scores of Gustav Mahler and other writings.",1969,,,,,45.4791248,9.167061,USA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpwO6Ig0YpU,Luciano Berio,P82,,,,,,

A86,Blue Jam: episode 1,"The mind of Chris Morris leaks onto radio in this dark, dreamlike blend of low-key comedy and music. Featuring Julia Davis, Mark Heap and Kevin Eldon.
Imprisoned in the infinite misery jumper? Help is at hand. Chris Morris is here to help you wallow in the melancholy. This opening salvo from the voice of On The Hour and The Day Today features a doctor who kisses everything better, a discussion of who should fill your brain-plate and a gun-toting gibbon.
Immediately prior to Blue Jam, Chris Morris had caused a furore with Channel 4's Brass Eye. Yet Blue Jam managed to be a total departure from his previous work. Originally airing late at night on BBC Radio 1, it's a blend of ambient music, deadpan ( sometimes brutal ) sketches and offbeat monologues. A whole audio landscape of the subconscious, the ad-hoc low-fi sheen of production lending it a kind of verisimilitude.
In sharp contrast with the personality-led comedies of recent years, Blue Jam makes a virtue of anonymity. It's a surprise to learn who's in it, or that it is in part written by Graham Linehan and Arthur Matthews. Rightly winning a clutch of Sony Awards, it remains unique - nothing before or after was remotely like it.",1997,BBC Radio 1,B31,Blue Jam,S28,51.5207202,-0.1427393,UK,http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03w472n,Chris Morris,P105,,,,,,

The three women were sent to Brens, where they co-habited with women from all over Europe—Jews, activists, prostitutes—separated into wooden huts by nationality.
