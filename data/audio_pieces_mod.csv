A1,Springtime It Brings On The Shearing,"A type of radio documentary, but one where the event is seen as through a pane of old and imperfect glass: time, distance and memory combine to blur the image. The reality is always - slightly - out of focus.Shearers have been shearing sheep in almost the same way since Europeans first came to Australia. Shearing is a centre of white Australian memory.'When we were children, we used to go to the shearing sheds, sometimes.' Something to do with history. Something to do with time.

A week before the radio broadcast, however, when Cage presented at the studios to make the recordings, he was told by the resident technician that what he wanted to do could not be done in the time allotted. Cage had to compose another work, just four days before the scheduled broadcast. The original manuscript is probably lost. The instruments called for include tin cans, muted gongs, woodblocks, alarm bells, tam tam, bass drum, Chinese tom tom, bongos, cowbells, maracas, claves, ratchet, pod rattle, foghorn, thunder sheet, sound-effect recordings, etc. The script recounts a surreal tale of a man called ‰Û÷The Voice' who wanders around a big city, meeting various characters and finding himself in mysterious circumstances.

A63,What's Rangoon to you is Grafton to me,"Back in the 1970s, the straight-laced ABC veered off the beaten path with a new experiment: Double J‰ÛÓa youth-oriented radio channel operating on a derelict AM transmitter in a bomb shelter. One of the channel's more live-wire DJs was a surfer-poet called Russell Guy. His crazed, ad-lib breakfast shows broke all the rules of broadcasting. In 1978, Guy decided to see if he could turn a short story about a summer hitch-hiking adventure from Brisbane to Sydney into a radio play. What's Rangoon to You is Grafton to Me ultimately went on to become a cult classic. He enlisted the help of ABC's beloved anchorman, James Dibble, to play his whacked-out road warrior protagonist.",1978,ABC,B1,,,"-33.8762946,151.2190482",Australia,http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/soundproof/features/from-the-vault/whats-rangoon-to-you-is-grafton-to-me/6759216,Russell Guy,P77,Graham Wyatt,,,,,
A64,Tokyo's Burning,"Tokyo's Burning was made to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the mass firebombing of Tokyo in March 1945 in which 100000 people died and several million were 'de-housed'.The feature includes eyewitness accounts from Japanese on the ground, and the French war correspondent Robert Guillain and a B 29 bomber pilot who describes in vivid detail the firestorm created by napalm. May 24 is the anniversary of the second big attack on Tokyo. The feature explores the history of the bombardment of civilian populations since the beginning of aerial warfare and also challenges the conventional wisdom that the atomic bombs were 'necessary' to end the war.

A74,Eschatology,"A radiophonic drama about the end of the world, witnessed from a liner adrift on a deserted ocean. Written and narrated by Peter Blegvad, Eschatology is a poetic exploration of the end of everything: of landwhere we take to ships, of radio contact when white noise fills the receiver; of individual sounds as they echo into space. Music and sound effects are composed and performed by Langham Research Centre (Felix Carey, Iain Chambers, Philip Tagney and Robert Worby), using vintage electronic instruments and tape machines. The last survivors are played by Harriet Walter and Guy Paul. Susan Rae delivers updates on the apocalypse as it spreads around the planet. Eschatology is a contemplative piece that encourages us to calmly consider how it would feel to witness the end of the world.",2014,BBC Radio 3,B7,Between The Ears,S17,"51.5188884,-0.1461194",UK,http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04hz0sb,,P86,,,,,,
A75,Sinfonia,"Sinfonia (Symphony) is a composition by the Italian composer Luciano Berio which was commissioned by the New York Philharmonic for its 125th anniversary. Composed in 1968‰ÛÒ69 for orchestra and eight amplified voices, it is a musically innovative post-serial classical work, with multiple vocalists commenting about musical (and other) topics as the piece twists and turns through a seemingly neurotic journey of quotations and dissonant passages. The eight voices are not used in a traditional classical way; they frequently do not sing at all, but speak, whisper and shout words by Claude LÌ©vi-Strauss, whose Le cru et le cuit provides much of the text, excerpts from Samuel Beckett's novel The Unnamable, instructions from the scores of Gustav Mahler and other writings.",1969,,,,,"40.772822,-73.983014",USA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpwO6Ig0YpU,Luciano Berio,,,,,,,
