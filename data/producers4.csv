Eno & Byrne's use of documentary sound (preachers, radio call-in shows, etc) to make music was inspirational to a guy crafting straight information documentaries. I was editing 1/4-inch tape and obsessed with making meaningful linear narratives; they were sampling (in what was then an analog universe) and rocking the house down. It was like audio amphetamine, using documentary sources for sound, rhythm and dance more than for narrative meaning.",A47,"I heard this at the first International Feature Conference I attended, in Berlin, in 1992, at a time when I wasn't sure what this thing called a ""feature"" was. I was used to a Canadian radio environment where mix scripts commonly had instructions like ""fade sound under voice"". So I was perplexed by the way Harri would abruptly drop a sound bed under a voiced narration - just a sharp 15db drop, boom. I remember going up to him afterwards and asking if it was a mistake, an early rough version of the mix. He fixed me with his slow Finnish stare, and said ""I got bored with fades."" It dawned on me that I could be free to create a feature in any way I liked, rather than being primarily concerned with what some imagined listenership expected. Easier to do if you're a tenured producer with a public broadcaster, harder if you're a freelancer trying to push a radically different mix past a commissioning editor.

I remember walking slowly back to my hotel through a park as if I were levitating. The sound, and the way her voice juxtaposes to the sound. The Russian film director Sergei Eisenstein wrote about a dialectical theory of editing, and Kaye's piece showed me how that works - juxtapositions with an irresistable magnetism that pulls the listener into the 4-dimensional world of the program. Magnificent.",A28,"So much has been written about this piece that there's nothing new I can add.

It's a magical piece, the atmospherics of the sound combining with an almost religious suggestibility about a tragic death in a Cape Verdean community in France.

It was just as I started making radio, so around '97 or '98. It's a story about sheering sheep in Australia, but it also becomes a story about the pioneers that came to Australia with the sheep and what that did to the aborigines. I remember that what struck me was the sonic space that it has and the textured landscape. Beautiful sound. You listen and it's like it's all around you. It's birds, raindrops and footsteps but it's not like sound art, it still has a real feeling, it's poetic but it's not taking things apart. It feels real. But it_—Ès reality seen through an artistic temper, through the temper of Kaye. When you meet Kaye she analyses the world that she is in from the floor to the sky. And I remember that I stopped at the radio when I heard it and thought _—“this is something else",A2,"I heard this around 98, '99 when I started in radio and its a piece about a social housing area, one block, where three murders have taken place and it's just fantastic. It's not a whodunit and I'm so glad it wasn't made now other wise it would have gone in like a detective, been serialised and come out with a head on a tray. It's just scenes cut with interview. The thing that blew me away when you hear it is that Stephen would be talking to someone and you could hear people arguing downstairs and he would capture the conversation between them. The emotional impact of hearing someone screaming through the walls. He is there as a storyteller, but he's very cool, like he knows more. He comes in very sparsely, a bit mystical, but you forget him as well. The place becomes a character, and it's about murders but it becomes about more than that, it becomes about the curse of social immobility. So social realism in it's finest form. I'm so relieved it wasn't there to solve a mystery but to be in the space.",A3,"Other pieces have influenced me a handicraft way, but this one has influenced me more in an imaginative way. I love radio pieces that open the door to some strange world that it is not at first sight realistic, it's a parallel world, it uses this black hole that radio is and populates it and suddenly it exists with the full power of existence and i really like it for that.

She is an Australian radio maker, who has made the bulk of her creative career from her Paris base. I have many favourites amongst her features, but the one with the longest and deepest influence is this sensitive excursion into childhood in the rural heartland where white pastoralists and Indigenous Australians lived alongside each other in mutuality, unequal and somewhat flawed, but bound by certain aspects of the land and the living they made there. The locus is a sheep shearing shed, evoked in wonderful field recordings made much later. There_—Ès a folk song which sets the yearning mood, and yields the feature_—Ès title. It_—Ès a classic feature, broadcast many times, a sound memory of time and ways of life now past, but residing in traces of remembering. The same themes return over and over in Kaye_—Ès works, without being overly apparent. Its lasting impact on me has been to acknowledge my own foundation story and absorb its themes, surreptitiously, into my radio work, as in Deserta Rerum, (1987) radiophonic rendering of a text by Kate Jennings, produced with composer Vineta Lagzdina, , and Persona (2003). The starting point is where you come from, where you speak from, what you hear, who you are.",A23,"I first heard this in the 1970s. A landmark Australian radio documentary of 1957, about race relations in the prosperous country town of Moree, where a comfortable white farming elite held tight to their privileges at the expense of the local Australian Aboriginal community. It was a study in attitudes that revealed shocking racial prejudice (in healthcare, housing policy and social fabric) and created a storm of protest. Unusually for the time, it was based on field recordings in which the voices of ordinary Australians could be heard (with parity to Indigenous speakers), edited and arranged with dramatic effect; overlaid with Ashbolt_—Ès brilliant, theatrical narration (in the vocal style of Peter Finch and Laurence Olivier). He later became my boss in the Department of Radio Special Projects, but never _—…instructed_—È us on how to proceed, other than to find our own way to the root of things, his notion of being _—…radical_—È. Following his death in 2005, I presented an on-air tribute in the history program Hindsight, including a slightly edited version of A Study in Attitudes.

My first contact with the remarkable tradition of Croatian radio occurred in 1984, when I met the legendary radio author and producer Zvonimir Bajsióö at the International Features Conference in Helsinki; and was invited soon after to spend time with him and his colleagues at the studios of Croatian Radio in Zagreb, on my first trip to explore my family_—Ès roots. This was one of several features I heard there, aided by an English transcript (I have a copy, not digitized, but could scan). It struck an immediate chord due to its stereophonic sound world, pristine location recordings, and its witty, satiric, poetic script that spoke of summer tourism on the Dalmatian coast as being _—…candy_—È. I couldn_—Èt wait to get there.



The lasting gift of the radio _—…candy_—È was an approach to writing and speaking narration, as in The Eternity Enigma. It need not be _—…reportage_—È. It could be literature, but presented in a down to earth way without pretensions. I was a young published poet and it then seemed possible that one could become a radio poet. Radio features could be artful, and appear artless.",A25,"I heard Sniper at the International Feature Conference (IFC) in Berlin 1993 where it caused a sensation. It was produced by Stephen Schwartz of Danish Radio, whose connections with a Bosnian colleague at Radio Sarajevo had hatched this amazing project: to record snipers from both sides of the siege of Sarajevo in non-judgemental, but remarkably intense psychological portraits, one of a young woman, whose nom de guerre was _—…Arrow_—È. It was riveting, and terribly upsetting, to hear how these two, young people from a magical city, so previously lauded for its multi-ethnic harmony _—” and which I had visited only a few years previously _—” were already hardened, engaging in the slaughter of people who, a short time before, had been their friends. A version with English voice-over translation was soon produced by RTE (at the behest of Lorelei Harris, I believe) which we broadcast on ABC Radio in The Listening Room 6 September 1993. 

Sniper had a profound influence on me as a feature maker, providing an example of how to deal with extreme conflict that differed from reportage, making a lasting creative artefact with emotional heft. Later conversations with Schwartz revealed his commitment to a strong dramaturgical foundation to achieve compelling listening. A vital skill. As an Australian of Balkan heritage at a remote from the deadly Balkan wars of the 1990s that erupted in the break -up of former Yugoslavia, I then found a way to make a _—…documentary_—È about this and other conflicts of the decade (Rwandan genocide, and nationalist insurgencies in the re-ascendant Russian imperium) at a distance _—– drawing on art history, poetic imagery, frank testimony, sound, and music to fashion a dramatic nightmare, a dream gone wrong: The Raft of the Medusa, broadcast 24 June 1996, The Listening Room, ABC Radio.

Amazing!",A31,"When I first heard this piece in the mid 1980's I was amazed at Gould's daring use of voice against voice, making music with speech.  Yes it can be overwhelming at times but I love the way this counterpoint brings the tension of life to the story, reflecting the fact that most of what we know is open to different interpretations and competing points of view.  This groundbreaking piece inspired me to produce ""The Idea of Canada"" in 1994 which in turn inspired, in 1998, a young Toronto composer Adam Goddard to produce, with me, Prix Italia winner ""The Change in Farming"".  How's that for a ""Canadian Lineage""?!",A29,"I heard this Prix Italia winner in 1991 and was blown away.  I still am all these years later. A troubled young musician has committed suicide.  The story is told by his parents and his girlfriend, with excerpts from his diary. It's a beautifully crafted piece but what really strikes me every time I hear it is the tone, the sound of the voices; so close, so intimate, you don't so much hear what they're saying, you feel it. I asked Mads Baastrup how he did it.  ""Get a good mic and put it in close"", he told me. If only it were that simple!",A30,"Jeannine Deckers, the Belgian novice whose 60's hit single ""Dominique"" topped the charts ahead of even the Beatles, gave the proceeds to her convent but, with no proper paper trail, was pursued by the Belgian tax authorities until, in 1985, she committed suicide. The story could have been told as a straight narrative, but Moya Henderson, a former nun and a professional singer played to her strengths and SANG it with verve and panache in a wide variety of styles -  from soft prayerful pleading to sharp sassy soliloquies. And there's great sound design from Phillip Ulman.  Be brave, be daring.  Easier said than done.  So thanks Moya for your idiosyncratic tour de force.",A27,"A whale lies dead and decaying on a beach on the Atlantic coast of the USA. The local townsfolk are asked ""What did you see?"" They agree it was a whale and it was big but after that we get a counterpoint of contradictory perceptions where each person seems to reveal as much  about themselves as they do about the whale.  After I heard this piece I began asking my own interviewees ""what did you see?"" and then, trying to turn the 'radio camera' around, ""OK now what did you ""see""?  The results were often quite wonderful.",

Paranthoën redefined roles in French radio, and with it, the sound of the medium. He elevated sound-gathering and appreciation from a purely technical aspect to an artistic element. He famously reexamined both the soundscape ecology of R Murray Schafer, and the radio reporter’s Nagra tape recorder itself, for radio. He reputedly forbade his station, France Culture, from rebroadcasting his programmes if they applied any audio compression beyond that which he defined in post-production.",1957,2005,B15,https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yann_Parantho’ân,P29,,,,,,,,,,,
